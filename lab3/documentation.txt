DOCUMENTATION LAB 3 (Scanner)

Symbols:

This class's purpose is to get the tokens from tokens.txt and classify them, based on the position on which we find the tokens.

Scanner:

To identify constants and identifiers we will use Regex expressions. Furthermore, we have some methods that will help us separate
strings and operators from given tokens. The method get_tokens(line) will return an array made of all tokens from a certain line.
The most important method is read_from_file(file), which reads the program from a given file and classifies all tokens and adds
the corresponding elements to the Program Internal Form file and the Symbol Table file.

SymbolTable:

SymbolTable(length) - returns an object of type SymbolTable (which is a hashtable) with a specified length
to_string() - prints the table
hash(key) - returns the position in which the key should be inserted
get_position(key) - returns a tuple that contains the index in the hash table and the position in the list from that index
in the hash table
add(key) - if the element already exists, the function will return its position; if not it will be added using the hash function
