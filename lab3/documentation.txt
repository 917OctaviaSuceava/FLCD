DOCUMENTATION LAB 3 (Scanner)

Symbols:

This class's purpose is to get the tokens from tokens.txt and classify them, based on the position on which we find the tokens.

Scanner:

To identify constants and identifiers we will use Regex expressions. Furthermore, we have some methods that will help us separate
strings and operators from given tokens. The method get_tokens(line) will return an array made of all tokens from a certain line.
The most important method is read_from_file(file), which reads the program from a given file and classifies all tokens and adds
the corresponding elements to the Program Internal Form file and the Symbol Table file.
